title="About Pandoc Papers"
+++


The [Pandoc Papers][pandoc-papers] project started as a personal initiative to
streamline the process of moving between different academic paper templates
using [pandoc]. Over time, it evolved into a separate repository that acts as a
centralised location containing "sane" defaults for various templates, as well
as a formalised metadata specification for academic papers.
