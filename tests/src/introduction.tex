\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\paragraph{Backgound} This document serves as a test for the different LaTeX
templates from the \kl{Pandoc Papers} repository.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Test 1
  \item Test 2
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[fill=blue!20] (0,0) rectangle (4,3);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{An example image.}
  \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

As shown in \cref{fig:example}, this is a simple figure created using TikZ.

\paragraph{Objective} The objective of this document is to test that common
elements such as sections, lists, and figures are rendered correctly across
different LaTeX templates.

\begin{theorem}[label=thm:sample,name={Main Theorem},restate=thm:sample]
  This is a sample theorem to demonstrate theorem environments in LaTeX.
\end{theorem}

The statement of \cref{thm:sample} illustrates how to define and reference.
Note that one can then use 

\csname thm:sample\endcsname* to restate the theorem programmatically.
